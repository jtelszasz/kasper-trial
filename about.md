My name is Justin, and by education and background I'm a mechanical engineer.  I help write energy efficiency policy for the U.S. Department of Energy but I'm also interested in data science.  More than anything though, I'm out to solve problems.  I use this blog as a means for exploring and researching topics I find interesting.  If you have ideas, data, questions, or problems hit me up!
